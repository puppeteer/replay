# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License

this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as

## Source Code Headers

Every file containing source code must include copyright and license

### How to release a new version

1. Open a PR containing the result of running `npm run release`. This should automatically update change log, bump the version and commit the changes.
2. After the PR lands, [create a new release](https://github.com/puppeteer/replay/releases/new):
   1. Specify a new tag in the format `v$VERSION` (e.g., `v0.1`).
   2. Specify the release title as `$VERSION` (e.g., `0.1`).
   3. Copy the part of the changelog corresponding to the current version to the description.

Once the release is created, a GitHub Actions job will automatically publish the new release to npm.
